//! # Brief
//!
//! In this blog series, we will be explore an embedding of Higher Kinded Types in Rust,
//! which we will use to build a toy type-level functional programming library, in the vein of Scalaz
//! and Cats.
//!
//! # Introduction
//!
//! Let's get this out of the way first: I'm not an expert functional programmer, nor am I a Rust
//! expert. I have about a year of functional programming experience in Scala, and while I've been
//! fooling around with Rust for 3 years and feel very comfortable with the language itself, I'm
//! basically clueless when it comes to systems programming.
//!
//! So, this isn't going to be a rigorous study. But I'm hoping it's fun and accessible to a cross
//! section of folks: FP people unfamiliar with Rust, and Rust people less familiar with FP.
//!
//! So, with that out of the way, let's get started.
